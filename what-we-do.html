                               I grew up in the Red Location, a township near Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape<br/> where my father had a medical practice for over 50 years. Red Location is the 2nd <br/>oldest black township in South Africa. It, like many other black communities, is<br/> plagued by poverty and has an unemployment rate in excess of 40%.
<br/>
<br/>
The name “RED” stems from the colour of the zinc with which the early dwellings <br/>in the area were built. This was material was exported from the concentration <br/>camps of the Anglo-Boer war. The Red Location, like most of province, the<br/> Eastern Cape, which has produced champions such as Makhaya Ntini and Siya <br/>Kolisi, has a dire shortage of sports facilities. The children of the community have <br/>thus little recreationally to do.
<br/>
<br/>
While the past, with all its oppressive lineaments, is unfortunately irrevocable, a <br/>new and better future can be created. During my time as President of Cricket<br/> South Africa and the Africa Cricket association, I witnessed the transformative <br/>power of sport on individuals, communities and on nations. None of the<br/> successful and thriving countries I visited didn’t have a very strong and pervasive <br/>culture of sport. Our goal therefore is to use sport as a tool to uplift and free the<br/> children in the Red Location from the shackles of their country’s past.

                                        <span style="font-size:20px;">Where I come from:</span>
                                        <br/>
 I was born and bred in Butterworth Cape Town, but have lived in Gqeberha (P.E.)<br/> since I obtained my law degree from Nelson Mandela University.<br/>
 <br/>

 <span style="font-size:20px;">What I do:</span>
 <br/>
 My first company was in fashion – Ayanna Fashion Cabin. From there I went on to<br/> work at the Master’s office where I learned how to administer deceased and <br/>living estates. After that I was a candidate attorney at Mbewana Attorneys – <br/>the largest, black-owned law firm in Gqeberha (P.E.).<br/>
 <br/>

 <span style="font-size:20px;">Why I am a R.E.D. Ambassador:</span>
 <br/>
 I am now a Director at Acketso Legal House. It is here that I started to champion <br/>different causes that give back to my community. I draft free wills for the elderly.<br/>
 <br/>
 I also sponsor and coach the St George’s football team. I am especially proud of <br/>the fact that the boys do not just go home with improved soccer skills but also a <br/>full tummy. I am passionate about giving back to the community and am<br/> honoured to be a R.E.D Ambassador.

                           Where I come from:
                           <br/>
                           I was born in New Brighton. My humble beginnings played a part in the person<br/> who I am today.
                           <br/>
                           <br/>
                           What I do:
                           <br/>
                           I am proud to say that I am an entrepreneur and the Director of Mthi Wembotyi<br/> Projects, a company that operates in the marine industry in the ports of Coega<br/> and Gqeberha.
                           <br/>
                           <br/>
                           I have been recognised by the South African Maritime Safety Authority as the<br/> first black-owned SMME business to operate within the marine sector in<br/> Gqeberha.
                           <br/>
                           <br/>
                           Why I am a R.E.D. Ambassador:
                           The name of my company, ‘Mthi Wembotyi’, is a strong tree that that carries<br/> seeds in large pods. The seeds symbolise hope and courage.  My passion is to<br/> bring hope and courage to the youth in the Red Location – that’s why I am <br/>a R.E.D. Ambassador.
